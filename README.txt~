Read this before running the app or the source code:
1. To switch on the server, type the command 'npm install' and 'node app2' in the server code's direcrory ie., server (for this to work, node and npm must be installed globally)
2. To run the executable, double click on the electronapp.exe file, present in the elecronapp direcrory(this executable works for windows now.. Similar executables can be easily built 
using the source code for other Operating systems, if required).
3. To run the source code, type 'npm install' and 'npm start' in the cmd from the source code's directory (npm and node has to be installed).
4. The dump of the database given must be used to install the database(we have used mysql), before setting up the server.
5. To test the app, you can use the data present in the sent database dump file. You can search for "anth" (which results everyone's position whose name contains anth as substring).
